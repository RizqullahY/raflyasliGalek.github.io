## Introduction
This website is designed as a personal portfolio to showcase projects, skills, and experience in the field of programming. It is a single-page application (SPA) or commonly called a Landing Page, consisting of several sections such as About Me, Portfolio, Blog, Tech, and Contact.


## Technologies Used
This project is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** 
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **Git**
- **GitHub**

## Brief Explanation
This project contains several files and folders. Below is a brief explanation of the contents of the project directory:

- **`index.html`**:  
  This is the main file of the portfolio website, containing the HTML structure. It includes all the main content of the website.

- **`robots.txt`**:  
  This file is used to manage search engine crawlers' access to certain pages of the website. With the `robots.txt` configuration, you can specify which pages are allowed or disallowed to be indexed by search engines like Google.

- **`tailwind.config.js`**:  
  This configuration file is used to customize Tailwind CSS. You can adjust themes, colors, typography, and breakpoints here to suit the design needs of your project.

- **`src/`**:  
  This directory contains the assets used by the website, such as images, icons, and CSS and JavaScript files.

3. If you want to modify the Tailwind styles, run the following command in the same directory as the `index.html` file:

   ```
